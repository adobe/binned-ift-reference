This repository contains code for a prototype of "binned" incremental
font transfer format.  Once the command-line program `iftb` is built
you can view its help information with `iftb -h` and then
`iftb [sub-command] -h` for its various sub-commands.

The wasm client code is for browser-side support. There is a modest 
demo in the "demo" directory that includes an already-built version
of the wasm code and Javascript wrapper.
