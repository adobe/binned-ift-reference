This repository contains code for a prototype of "binned" incremental
font transfer format.  Once the command-line program `iftb` is built
you can view its help information with `iftb -h` and then
`iftb [sub-command] -h` for its various sub-commands.

The wasm client code is for browser-side support. See the demo at
[https://git.corp.adobe.com/siterum/iftc_demo](https://git.corp.adobe.com/siterum/iftc_demo).

The code in the `python` directory is mostly notional at this stage.
